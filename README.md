# Machine Learning Stock Predictor

## Concept

I wanted to build a project that would take the last few years of stock trends and predict the movement of the stock in the future.

## Implementation

I used Tensorflow in python to train models on historic data (2012-2021) from Yahoo Finanace and then predict how the stock would move the next day. I then expanded it to continue predicting days out. I also built another program that would take the data and visualize it into line graphs.

I also saved the ML models so that they would not need to be retrained to be reused in the future
